# application-error-handling CHANGELOG

## 1.0.3 (register-sweep patch, 2026-09-10)

- Register: neutral wording in shipped prose (no capability change).

## 1.0.2 (application-core completion pass, 2026-09-09)

- Adds top-level elicits[] block on blueprint.json declaring the one apply-time answer (classification-additions); backed by REQ-003 naming the transient/permanent/unknown defaults and the elicited-additions grammar per section 7c.
- Adds refusal-path ACs to US-16102 (stack-and-path scrubbing, non-Error throw defaults, mid-stream exception connection close), US-16104 (non-object context refusal, nested-and-array redaction, circular context handling), US-16105 (permanent no-Retry-After, unknown mapped as permanent, elicited-category retry contract), US-16106 (no-companion fallback stderr JSON single line, direct console.error passthrough, companion factory throw fallback), US-16107 (null-injection refusal, stub invocation contract, transportWriter throw recovery). US-16101 and US-16103 also extended with clean-shutdown preservation, browser-runtime path, double-throw handling, deep cause chain, cause-context redaction and null-vs-undefined cause discipline. Every story now at the 7a floor (4-5 ACs per story, 30 ACs total).

## 1.0.1 (application-core hardening, 2026-09-09)

- hardening pass: chain-consistency lint zero (pass1 + pass2); added deliveredBy to every REQ, added ownerRef and disposition to every AC per section 7b, closed `boundaryFor` and `transportWriter` restatements on AC-16107-1 via ownerRef back to TAC-1701.
- Added AC-16101-2 (unhandled promise rejection: one record under the `unknown` category, process terminates with exit code 1) covering the 2026-09-08 review finding F-1 on TAC-1701.responsibilities[0].
